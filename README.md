This is my Module 19 Challenge- "CryptoClustering"
##
In this challenge, I was tasked with using my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
##
To do this, I:

1. Loaded and pre-processed the cryptocurrency market data, ensuring it was properly scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the values.
2. Applied the K-Means algorithm to the scaled data and used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. Reduced the dimensionality of the data to three principal components to simplify the analysis while retaining key information.
4. Created scatter plots to visualize how cryptocurrencies were grouped based on their price change percentages over different timeframes. I compared clustering results with and without PCA to evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction.
5. Analyzed the clustering performance by comparing the inertia values and the spread of the clusters, concluding how reducing features through PCA affects the clarity and granularity of the results.

The "CryptoCLustering.ipynb" file with the answered questions can be found in the "Analysis" folder. 

The data can be found in the "Resources" folder.

I thought this challenge went pretty smoothly! It was the first one I can remember where I didn't get any errors, which felt great. Hopefully it is what you are looking for and thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment.
